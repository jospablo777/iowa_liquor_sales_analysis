# Iowa Liquor Sales data analysis

## About this project

Here we will explore the the data set "Iowa Liquor Sales" which is freely available. The scope of this analysis is intended as a first exploration of the data resources of the Iowa Open Data Platform. First, we will conduct a basic data exploration process, and then we will use statistical inferences to answer two specific questions:

1.  Can the diversity in our inventory increase the sales of our store?

2.  Did the pandemic increased the alcoholic intake of alcohol in the population?

You can take this as a history I tell with the data at hand, but also as a tutorial of some things that can be done using time series data. So please do not hesitate in using the code below in your professional/personal projects. Also, if you have any feedback I will be happy to receive it :)

Feel free to check the source code for this analysis in this GitHub repo. Probably the Quarto [file](https://github.com/jospablo777/iowa_liquor_sales_analysis/blob/main/communication/iowa_liquor_analysis.qmd) will be the most informative for you. But please explore the rest of the repository.

[Here](https://jospablo777.github.io/iowa_liquor_sales_analysis/iowa_liquor_analysis.html) is the website with the rendered report.

## About the data set

The [data set](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data) we will be using contains information about the purchase of spirits made by grocery, liquor, and convenience stores, including supermarkets. This data is provided by the Iowa Open Data Platform and is constantly updated. It includes item descriptions and geospatial data, and is licensed under Creative Commons, which means that its use is less restrictive than other types of data. However, it's important to note that the data only includes purchases of spirits, and does not include beer, wine, or moonshine purchases. Therefore, we do not have a complete picture of alcohol consumption.

If you plan on running an analysis using this data set, I recommend using a machine with at least 32 GB of RAM, as the data is around 12 GB in size. No GPU will be required for this task.

## About the tools used

The chosen analysis tool was the R language for statistical computing alongside the Tidyverse ecosystem. Because itâ€™s free, open-source, and one of the most powerful tools available for this purpose. Also, we can guarantee the reproducibility of the analysis/solution with this methodology.

This web page was generated with Quarto. Here, we have the code and a narrative backed by our results, all in the same document. Great for auditing processes! And also for the result presentation.

For instance, if I made an error during the analysis, you can easily keep track of what happened and why. Similarly, if we achieved excellent results, the same code can be reused in the future.
